WildFly 9 will be provided in two versions: Wildfly Web and Wildfly Full but users will be able to create their custom packaging of WildFly.\nUsers will be able to shutdown the application server in a graceful manner - after the shutdown command is executed server will reject new requests and allow existing requests to finish before it shuts down.\nSupport to HTTP/2, a new version of HTTP protocol based on SPDY, will be introduced.\nUsers will be able to use WildFly as a load balancer.  Consequently, it will be possible to manage the balancer with the same tools that are used to manage the rest of the domain. What is more, users will be able to use more efficient protocols, such as HTTP/2, for communication between the balancer and backend servers.\nAn OpenShift cartdridge, which will enable users to use WildFly 9 in cloud environment, will be provided.\nWildFly 9 will use OpenJDK ORB library instead of JacORB.", "confName": "Devoxx, Poland 2015", "title": "What's New in WildFly 9"}, {"url": "http://cfp.2015.devoxx.pl/2015/talk/UMF-4595/Nashorn,_what_is_the_whole_buzz_about.html", "abstract": "Project Nashorn - a small addition to the Java 8, that allows to run efficiently run JavaScript on JVM. Many has scratched their head why the heck it's being announced as a big thing for Java.\nDuring the course of this talk, I'll try to convince everyone in the room that Nashorn is not only academic toy to play after (work) hours with something. It's a powerful tool with many usages, we'll see couple of 'em.\nWhole thing is going to be from Java developer perspective, however non Java speaking folks, should also be able to benefit, especially if you know only Node and want to go beyond.\nOn the same note, it's not another Nashorn vs Node talk! It's all about Nashorn, and each example we'll check out is focused only on it and unique platform features.", "confName": "Devoxx, Poland 2015", "title": "Nashorn, what is the whole buzz about"}, {"url": "http://cfp.2015.devoxx.pl/2015/talk/UDO-8681/Supler:_complex_web_forms,_not_so_complex.html", "abstract": "Let\u2019s face it. Creating websites with complex forms is a pain, and usually ends in lots of code duplication and frustration.\nThat\u2019s why we have decided to create Supler. Supler has a very focused set of functionality:\n\na Scala DSL for defining forms, generating JSON form description, applying values to backing objects and running actions & validations on the backend\na Javascript HTML form renderer, client-side validations, form templating and automatic reloading\n\nAs important as Supler features, are its non-features: no defined web or Javascript framework, no defined ORM layer, no defined backing object lifecycle etc. We aim to shape Supler as a library, not a framework, so that you can use it with a variety of software stacks.\nCome and see some live-coding showing various Supler features, and explaining the Supler approach!", "confName": "Devoxx, Poland 2015", "title": "Supler: complex web forms, not so complex"}, {"url": "http://cfp.2015.devoxx.pl/2015/talk/TOL-8245/Babun_-_a_Windows_shell_you_will_love,_finally!.html", "abstract": "The truth is really brutal.

It features oh-my-zsh, package-manager, programming tools and much more.\nBabun has been downloaded by 50K developers in the first months and rocks the Windows world ever since. Interested?

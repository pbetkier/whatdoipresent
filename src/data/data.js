How granular should a microservice be, and what approach should you use to determine the proper and appropriate boundaries between microservices? How can each microservice communicate with others in a distributed computing environment to correctly fulfill business objectives? How can my microservices adhere to the tenets of reactive software, being responsive, resilient, elastic, and message driven? Using Domain-Driven Design and Actors to implement microservices, this talk will demonstrate how you can create microservices while answering all of the questions posed, and more. The talk will show you how to carefully craft microservices and to model the business domain within. You will experience advanced use of the Actor model throughout.",

	"abstract": "The way software is developed and run in production has changed dramatically over the past ten years. These changes are just now reaching the “mainstream” who are looking to respond to the idea that “software is eating the world” and use software like all the “unicorns” we read about in the market. Getting your advice strictly from unicorn companies can feel a lot like getting dieting advice from celebrities: it sure will work if you have unlimited resources, few constraints, and, well, are already successful. What can the rest of shlubs who actually work in “the real world do” to get closer to the benefits of being “cloud native”? <br> This talk answers that question by looking at the current state of IT and how the role of IT has changed in recent years: if around ⅔ of businesses think IT doesn’t help them innovate, how is IT going to be effective in an era where custom written software is key to surviving and thriving in a business world where competitive advantages are now highly transient?",

I was sure that Agile solves all world’s problems. I would laugh over Scott Adam’s Dilbert comics with his Pointy Hair Boss. Life was simple, life was good. Now for 8+ years I have been running a software company, not a small one anymore. I became myself a full-time boss who only codes sometimes at home or during hackathons. This session is about sharing with you those critical lessons which I painfully learnt when trying to grow into this new role - transitioning from being a software engineer into being an entrepreneur and top manager. Wheres not all of the lessons may or will (if you dream about your own startup) apply to your case, being aware of them may save you tons of time, energy, money or even help you to avoid the total disaster - burying your own company, dreams or destroying your team. And after all, sharing war stories from the past is fun … when these stories are the past.",

This is painfully obvious when building microservices, where each service must truly own its state. <br> The reality is that you don't need 'stateless' services to either scale out or be fault tolerant -- what you really need is a scalable, fault tolerant state management solution that you can build your services around. <br> In this talk we will discuss how some of the popular microservices frameworks are tackling this problem, and will look at technologies available today that make it possible to build scalable, highly available systems without 'stateless' service layers, whether you are building microservices or good ol' monoliths.",

Many big-web sites like Twitter, Google, Amazon and Netflix have all had to answer these questions, often at great expense. Some, like Netflix, have open-sourced some of their work. <br> Netflix, by the way, is a huge user of Spring Boot, and we've learned a lot about their use-cases building cloud-native and microservice centric systems. <br> Spring Cloud is a set of Spring Boot extensions that wrap and adapt important parts of Netflix OSS's components that support key concepts for building microservices: service registration and discovery (with Eureka), reliability patterns (with Hystrix), client-side routing patterns (with Ribbon), etc. Spring Cloud also fills in gaps for things like distributed and journaled configuration. <br> In this talk, we'll look at how it all stitches together to make building cloud-native and microservice centric systems a breeze!",

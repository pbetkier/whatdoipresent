Each organisation is different and any change on this scale is going to have to adapt to emerging conditions. How can your organisation get the predictability it wants for planning and budgeting, and still benefit from the rich feedback of iterative agile delivery? And how can your staff develop and build a career in a flat organisation?\nTony Grout and Chris Matts think the answer might lie in the emerging areas of Business Mapping and Skills Liquidity.

We'll see how Neo4j uses the Raft protocol for a robust underlay for intensive write operations, and how the asynchronous new scale-out mechanism provides enormous capacity for very demanding graph workloads.\nWe'll discuss the cluster architecture's new causal consistency model. Causal consistency is a big leap forward compared to the commonplace eventual consistency which makes it convenient to write applications that use the full capacity of the cluster. In particular we'll show how despite the mixture of concensus protocols and asynchronous replication, that Neo4j allows users to read their own writes straightforwardly and discuss why this is such a difficult achievement in distributed systems.\nFor the application developer, we'll show how Neo4j's Causal Clustering optimised drivers makes it easyto write applications that scale smoothly from a single server to a large, distributed cluster: a practical motivation for the distributed systems enthusiast.", "confName": "QCon, London 2017", "title": "Causal Consistency For Large Neo4j Clusters"}, {}, {"url": "https://qconlondon.com/london-2017/london-2017/presentation/the-oracle-problem.html", "abstract": "Will cover: why the oracle problem is so hard (specifically, this historical evolution of failures, from API, to clearnet website, to darknet website, to multisig escrow, to judicial \"competition\", to Ethereum/Augur, and why they fail), may also cover basics of blockchain (\"blockchain as immortal software\", ledger \"rents\", revenge of \"the idea guy\").", "confName": "QCon, London 2017", "title": "Blockchain: The Oracle  Problems"}, {"url": "https://qconlondon.com/london-2017/london-2017/presentation/observability-event-sourcing-and-state-machines.html", "abstract": "What is a way to have complete transparency of the state of a service? Ideally we would record everything - the inputs, outputs and timings - in order to capture highly reproducible and transparent state changes.

We'll do this in the context of a little known paper entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cLog Structured Merge Trees\u00e2\u0080\u009d. LSM describes a surprisingly counterintuitive approach to storing and accessing data in a sequential fashion. It came to prominence in Google's Big Table paper and today, the use of Logs, LSM and append only data structures drive many of the world's most influential storage systems: Cassandra, HBase, RocksDB, Kafka and more.

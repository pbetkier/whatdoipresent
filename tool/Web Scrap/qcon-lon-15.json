They were thinking about something that would change the world, it would make the world easy and give programmers almost unlimited power! It was simply referred to as JSR 107, one of the only things to change in the journey of this JSR. These dreamers were way ahead of their time and nothing really happened. So time passed by and by and by and over the years it was buried in the deep catacombs of the JCP. Eventually, in 2011 two brave knights took on the fight and worked themselves through all the riddles, to complete their quest in 2014. You'll know what I'm talking about, they called it the \"Java Caching API\" or in short \"JCache\".\nA software system cannot possibly be imagined without Caching today and it was time for a standard. No matter if you want to cache Database, HTML or results of long running calculations, new systems have to reach a critical mass to be successful.

Interaction with the media is layered so you can swap between UDP, Inifiniband, or Shared Memory as required.\n\u00a0\nAeron is open-source with implementations in Java and C++ that interoperate. There are no unnecessary features to bloat the implementation, yet the design is open so that it can be composed into higher level abstractions.\n\u00a0\nThis talk will focus on the design of Aeron and what we learned trying to achieve very consistent performance. We will explore the challenges of dealing with reliable message delivery over UDP and the data structures necessary to support transmission and retransmission in in a lock-free and wait-free manner.", "confName": "QCon, London 2015", "title": "Aeron: The next generation in high-performance messaging"}, {"url": "https://qconlondon.com/london-2015/presentation/product-ownership-team-sport.html", "abstract": "A number of agile brands downplay the need for business analysis and requirements management on agile projects, putting large store in the role of the Product Owner. This talk tackles some of the problems this misconception can result in and shows how effective product ownership almost always requires a team with a variety of skills and backgrounds to be effective.\n\u00a0\nProduct Ownership requires clarity of vision, alignment with organizational strategy, understanding of the development process and the ability to communicate with a wide variety of stakeholders across all levels both inside and outside the organization. The complexity of the role is most often more than a single person can (or should) cope with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 effective product ownership requires a teamwork approach covering a variety of skills and knowledge.", "confName": "QCon, London 2015", "title": "Product ownership is a team sport"}, {"url": "https://qconlondon.com/london-2015/presentation/operating-microservices.html", "abstract": "Microservices is the new cool architecture, and developers and architects are all jumping on the bandwagon, often without thinking about how they are going to operate the microservice.\n\nMicroservices architecture changes your software from a monolithic complicated system to a complex distributed system, and there are ways the operations team will have to change how they operate the system, and the way they interact with the development teams.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover how DevOps-like patterns can be applied on microservices to give the development teams more responsibility for their choices, and how monitoring, logging, auditing, security and other concerns can be managed in a distributed system.", "confName": "QCon, London 2015", "title": "Operating microservices"}]
